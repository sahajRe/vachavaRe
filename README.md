Okay, the below information and this software provided as is, with no guarantee 
of the effectiveness or reliability of the information and software.

DO use your battery frequently and lightly, ideally completing 1-2 charge 
cycles per week (minimum one charge cycle per month). [1]
For proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to keep the 
electrons in it moving occasionally. Apple does not recommend leaving your
portable plugged in all the time. [2]

DO properly calibrate your battery when new and approximately every 2-3 months thereafter. [1]
The battery needs to be recalibrated from time to time to keep the 
onscreen battery time and percent display accurate and to keep the
battery operating at maximum efficiency. [2]

DON’T fully discharge your battery frequently (the infrequent, periodic calibration is an exception). [1]

DON’T store your battery (or your computer) in a high temperature environment, 
such as the trunk of a car, especially a fully-charged battery. [1]

DON’T run your MacBook or MacBook Pro on AC power with the battery removed. [1]
